Artemis Financial was a hypothetical company used for this course project. In the scenario, Artemis Financial provided financial planning services through a RESTful web application that handled sensitive client information. The goal of the project was to review the application and identify security vulnerabilities that could affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The main issue I was asked to address was determining where the application was weak from a security standpoint and recommending ways to improve secure communication and protect user data.

One thing I did well in this project was identifying security issues through manual code review and static testing. I was able to recognize problems such as hardcoded credentials, missing input validation, lack of authentication, and outdated dependencies. Secure coding is important because even small mistakes can lead to serious security risks, especially in applications that handle financial data. Software security adds value to a company by protecting user information, maintaining trust, and reducing the chance of data breaches or legal issues.

The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was understanding how third-party libraries and dependencies can introduce security risks. At the same time, this was also one of the most helpful parts of the project because it showed how automated tools can find vulnerabilities that may not be obvious just by looking at the code.

I increased layers of security by recommending improvements such as stronger transport security, proper input validation, authentication and authorization, and updating outdated libraries. In the future, I would continue using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check, static analysis, and secure coding guidelines to assess vulnerabilities and decide on mitigation techniques.

To make sure the application remained functional and secure, I reviewed the code changes after refactoring and considered how fixes could affect the overall behavior of the application. Re-running security scans and reviewing error handling helped ensure that new vulnerabilities were not introduced during the process.

The tools and practices used in this project, including vulnerability assessment techniques, dependency scanning, and secure coding principles, will be useful in future coursework and real-world development work. For future employers, this project demonstrates my ability to analyze an application, identify security risks, and recommend practical solutions to improve software security in a realistic, but hypothetical, scenario.
